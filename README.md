## -re-cyclescan

(re)cyclescan is an app that makes recycling a game through the use of QR codes and a corresponding point system.  

Upon first opening the app, and pressing get started, a dashboard with the users scans and awards is displayed. There is also an option that allows a user to instantly scan a QR code.  

Based on the task completed- whether that be recycling cans, glass, paper, electronics, or even clothing- the user gets a certain amount of points. These points can be redeemed in the my awards section of our app for small prizes.  

We developed this iOS app using **Swift** and **XCode**, with **UIKit** and **AVFoundation** frameworks, **Firebase** for a realtime database, and **Core Data** for a local data store. The app was prototyped in and designed using **Figma**.
